# Resistor Ohm Calculator!
A user-friendly program that allows you to calculate the resistance of a certain resistor by colours!

# How it works
In electronics, Resistors are essential. Ohms is a unit of resistance in a resistor, Therefore resistors are often colour-coded in order for you to be able to easily identify them.

However, remembering this chart isn't easy. Which is why i've provided a simple console-based interface in order to identify a resistor.
